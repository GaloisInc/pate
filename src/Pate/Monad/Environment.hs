{- Note [Symbolic Backend Locking]

We spawn multiple threads to do a great deal of work in generating and
discharging the equivalence proof. Unfortunately, symbolic execution is not
thread safe, as the assumption stack is stored in an IORef. To make this safe,
until we can develop a safer data sharing strategy, we use an MVar as a lock
that must be acquired before symbolically executing any code.

Note that the lock is just a `MVar ()` instead of an `MVar SymBackend`. This is
because many places in the verifier use the symbolic backend in ways that *are*
thread safe. Only symbolic execution is not. Thus, we have a separate lock just
for symbolic execution instead of serializing all accesses to the symbolic
backend (e.g., term creation).

It would be an interesting experiment to make an alternative backend that stored
thread-local assumption stacks (e.g., keyed by threadid).

-- | The type of architecture-specific dedicated registers
--
-- Dedicated registers are registers whose purpose is fixed by an ABI, and whose
-- value never changes between two variants (i.e., original and patched
-- binaries).
--
-- For example, the most common PowerPC 64 ABI stores the Table of Contents
-- (TOC) pointer in r2; while this can change when switching modules at
-- run-time, it never varies between two variants. This enables us to assert
-- that it should always be equal, while also tracking its known concrete values
-- (which simplifies other proof obligations).
--
-- Each architecture backend will provide its own type for this; if it is not
-- needed, it can be instantiated as 'Data.Void.Void'
type family DedicatedRegister arch :: LCT.CrucibleType -> DK.Type

-- | Functions for identifying and working with architecture-specific dedicated registers
--
-- Note that this is data instead of a class because it varies by ABI (and not just architecture)
data HasDedicatedRegister arch =
  HasDedicatedRegister { asDedicatedRegister :: forall tp . MC.ArchReg arch tp -> Maybe (DedicatedRegister arch (MS.ToCrucibleType tp))
                       -- ^ Determine whether or not a register is a 'DedicatedRegister'
                       , dedicatedRegisterValidity :: forall sym bin tp . (LCB.IsSymInterface sym) => sym -> PMC.EquivalenceContext sym arch -> PB.WhichBinaryRepr bin -> PSR.MacawRegEntry sym tp -> DedicatedRegister arch (MS.ToCrucibleType tp) -> IO (PS.AssumptionFrame sym)
                       -- ^ Compute an assumption frame for the given arch-specific 'DedicatedRegister'
                       }

-- | An indicator of how a register should be displayed
--
-- The ADT tag carries the semantics of the register (e.g., if it is a normal
-- register or a hidden register).  The payloads contain the proper rendering of
-- the register in a human-readable form (or whatever else the caller wants).
--
-- Note that the order of the constructors is intentional, as we want "normal"
-- registers to be sorted to the top of the pile

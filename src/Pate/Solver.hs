-- various constraints that we need in the verifier
--
-- In many uses of what4, the concrete type of the symbolic backend does not
-- need to be known. However, the pate tool does need to know because it
-- manually traverses terms to simplify and analyze them.
--
-- We also carry the chosen solver adapter in this wrapper, as the symbolic
-- backend and the adapter share a type parameter (@st@) that we do not want to
-- expose to the rest of the verifier (since it would pollute every type
-- signature).
--
-- This type allows us to unwrap the constraints when we need them to observe
-- the relationships between these otherwise internal types.

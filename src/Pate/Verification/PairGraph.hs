--   ReturnNode for the current function under analysis.
--   When a ReturnNode is visited in the analysis, its abstract

-- | The PairGraph is the main datastructure tracking all the
--   information we compute when analysing a program. The analysis we
--   are doing is essentially a (context insensitive) forward dataflow
--   analysis.
--
--   The core assumption we make is that the pair of programs being
--   analysed are nearly the same, and thus have control flow that
--   advances nearly in lockstep. The abstract domains capture
--   information about where the program state differs and we
--   propagate that information forward through the program attempting
--   to compute a fixpoint, which will give us a sound
--   overapproximation of all the differences that may exist between
--   runs of the two programs.
--
--   As we compute the fixpoint we note cases where we discover a
--   location where we cannot keep the control-flow synchronized, or
--   where we discover some observable difference in the program
--   behavior. These "program desyncrhonization" and "observable
--   difference" occurences are ultimately the information we want to
--   deliver to the user.
--
--   We additionally track situations where we cut off the fixpoint
--   computation early as reportable situations that represent
--   limitations of the analysis; such situations represent potential
--   sources of unsoundness that may cause us to miss desyncronization
--   or observable difference events.

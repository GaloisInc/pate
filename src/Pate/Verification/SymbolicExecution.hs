-- or aborts. Note that there should not be any cases where symbolic execution
-- aborts, as we have no assertions in the binary.

{- Note [Loop Breaking]

There's a slight hack here.

The core problem we're dealing with here is that renovate blocks
can have multiple basic blocks; and almost always do in the
rewritten binary. We want to stitch them together in the right
way, and part of that means deciding whether basic block
terminators are things we should "follow" to their target to
continue symbolically executing or not. Normally any block
terminator that goes to another basic block in the same renovate
block is one we want to keep symbolically executing through.

BUT if there is an actual self-contained loop within a single
renovate block, we want to avoid trying to symbolically execute
that forever, so we'd like to pick some of the edges in the
"block X can jump to block Y" graph that break all the cycles,
and mark all of those as terminal for the purposes of CFG
creation.

Instead of doing a careful analysis of that graph, we adopt the
following heuristic: kill any edges that point to the entry
point of the renovate block, and symbolically execute through
all the others. This catches at the very least any
single-basic-block loops in the original binary and in most
cases even their transformed version in the rewritten binary. If
we ever kill such an edge, we have certainly broken a cycle; but
cycles could appear in other ways that we don't catch.

This heuristic is reflected in the code like this: when deciding
if a jump should be killed, we compare jump targets to a
collection of "internal" addresses, and kill it if the target
isn't in that collection. Then we omit the entry point's address
from that collection, so that jumps to it are considered terminal.

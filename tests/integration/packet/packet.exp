#!/usr/bin/env -S expect -f
#
# This is an expect script modeling the user interaction of PATE on the packet example.
#
# Beyond testing basic verifier functionality, this test is also intended to
# provide an integration test of the 1) terminal user interaction, and 2)
# resulting equivalence condition, in ways that the other automated tests do not.
# The test for the "expected" equivalence condition is syntactic, so this test will
# likely be more brittle (e.g. break if the term simplification changes such that
# intermediate variable numbers change) and may need to be updated to reflect
# intended subsequent changes to PATE verification details.
#
# This test is intended to be run from the root of the pate directory:
#    ./tests/integration/packet/packet.exp
#
# Note that expected strings must be escaped: double-quotes (\") and brackets (\\\[)
#
# Also note this example is mentioned in the README.rst and used in the User Manual.
# Major changes here likely warrant an update of the corresponding User Manual content.

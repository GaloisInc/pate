\label{sec:run-pate-verif}

Once \pate{} has been built as described in Section~\ref{sec:build-pate-verif}, use the Docker container (or \texttt{pate.sh} script if building locally from source) to invoke \pate{}.

Invoking \pate{} presents the user with an interactive terminal user interface for analyzing a pair of binaries.
Users provide at least the paths to two (the ``original'' and ``patched'') binaries at the command line when invoking \pate{}.
Additionally, we recommend also specifying the desired entry point, using \texttt{-s <symbol>}.
Providing the specific function of interest will enable \pate{} to begin reasoning closer to the relevant functionality of interest, greatly reducing the total analysis time required compared to starting from the program entry point.
An example invocation using Docker looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
  docker run --rm -it \
    --platform linux/amd64 \
    -v "$(pwd)"/z:/z \
    pate \
    --original /z/my.original.exe \
    --patched /z/my.patched.exe \
    -s start_function_name
\end{verbatim}

Users may also wish to provide ``hint'' inputs that provide metadata that maps symbol names to addresses, easing analysis of stripped binaries.
Please see the listing below for details.

\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{--assume-stack-scope}

This flag causes \pate{} to assume that out-of-scope stack slots 
(i.e. slots that are past the current stack pointer) are always equal between
the two binaries.
Although in actuality they may have differing out-of-scope stack
contents, programs that exercise proper stack hygiene should never
access those values. By assuming they are equal, \pate{} avoids 
creating spurious counter-examples where under-specified pointers
alias inequivalent, but out-of-scope, stack slots.
This is a fairly strong assumption that can have unintended side effects,
including assuming \emph{false} when out-of-scope stack contents are
\emph{provably} inequivalent.

The \TOOL{}\footnote{The name \TOOL{} comes from the project name Patches Assured up to Trace Equivalence} tool is a static relational verifier for binaries with the goal of proving that two binaries have the same observable behaviors. %
It is intended for proving that security micropatches applied to binaries are safe. %
When it cannot, \TOOL{} provides detailed explanations that precisely characterize the difference in behavior between the two binaries. %
\TOOL{} is intended to be usable by \emph{domain experts}, rather than verification experts, and its explanations are designed to be in domain terms as much as possible. %

The \TOOL{} verifier is intended to enable users to: %
\begin{itemize}
\item precisely reason about the effects of patches applied to binaries,
\item explain potential differences in observable behaviors, accounting for all possible execution paths (prior to testing), and
\item reduce the time required to develop safe binary patches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Block Info Format}\label{sec:options:block-info}

The \texttt{--blockinfo=FILE} argument enables users to provide extra information to the verifier to improve its results.  The file it requires has the following format:

\begin{lstlisting}
  PatchData { patchPairs = [(origEntryAddr, patchedEntryAddr)]
            , ignoredPointers = ([(origDataAddr, origDataSize)]
                               , [(patchedDataAddr, patchedDataSize)]
                               )
            , equatedFunctions = [(inlineOrigAddr, inlinePatchedAddr)]
            }
\end{lstlisting}

where the values on the right-hand sides of the assignments are concrete values to be filled in.  Each field has the following meaning:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[\texttt{patchPairs}] A list of pairs of addresses. Each pair of addresses specifies function addresses in the original and patched binaries, respectively, that the user asserts to be equivalent. The first entry is used as the program entry point if the user has specified the \texttt{--ignoremain} option.  Otherwise, the analysis will start from the program entry points declared in the ELF header.
\item[\texttt{ignoredPointers}] Together with the \texttt{equatedFunctions} field, this enables the inline callee functionality described in \cref{sec:inlining}. The elements of the pair are lists of memory regions whose contents should be ignored while verifying equivalence of two programs (specifically under the scope of a pair of equated functions). The first element of the pair are ignored memory regions for the original binary, while the second element are ignored memory regions for the patched binary. Precisely, each location specification is of the form \emph{(dataAddr, dataSize)}, where the \emph{dataAddr} is the address of a pointer that points to \emph{dataSize} bytes of memory. This is an important subtlety: it really refers to the address of a pointer, and the buffer referred to is the buffer at the address pointed to. This enables the inline callee feature to refer to dynamically allocated memory that does not have a fixed global memory location.
\item[\texttt{equatedFunctions}] A list of pairs of function addresses that are intended to be equivalent for the purposes of the inline callee feature.

% \subsection{Logging Output}\label{sec:options:logging-output}

\subsection{Interactive UI}\label{sec:options:interaction}

\TOOL{} provides an interactive UI for monitoring proof progress and for exploring proof results.  To enable it, pass the \texttt{--interactive} flag (optionally using the \texttt{--port} flag to control the port that the web server will listen on).  Visiting \texttt{localhost} on the specified port will bring up the interactive UI, which serves two purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Streaming analysis events into a virtual console in the browser window
\item Taking snapshots of the automatically generated equivalence proof, enabling exploration of the proof goals and the results of attempting to prove them
\end{enumerate}

The interactive view enables visualization of the proof graph, which mirrors the call graph of the program. Clicking on any node in the proof graph displays detailed information about the corresponding code, as well as the proof obligations at that location. If source code is provided with the \texttt{--original-source} and \texttt{--patched-source} options, function source code will be shown for each node in the proof graph.

\subsection{Debugging Options}

There are a number of options useful for debugging the \TOOL{} verifier. The \texttt{--save-macaw-cfgs} option enables users to save intermediate artifacts from code discovery for later inspection. This is most useful for identifying code discovery failures, unsupported instructions, incorrect semantics, or control flow within functions.

The \texttt{--solver-interaction-file} option enables users to save the interactions between the \TOOL{} verifier and the SMT solver. This can be useful for diagnosing slow queries or SMT solver bugs (e.g., invalid models). The recorded interaction session can be replayed by simply running the SMT solver directly on it. It also records SMT solver responses (e.g., models from counterexamples).
